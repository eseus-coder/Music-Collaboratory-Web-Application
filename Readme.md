## Problem Description

Suppose you are travelling with friends or families and for the purpose of entertainment you are playing music. What other platform is better than Spotify (i.e. if you have premium account, P.S: you don’t want to listen to the ads). But it’s becoming very difficult as everyone has their own taste and  choices and depending on the current mood one might not feel like listening to a particular song, so, what’s the easy way out? One can take the majority of the votes, calculate it manually and change or skip the song but this will be very hectic and it will ruin the experience of the trip itself, of which one would not want to have an experience of. 

In such a situation, you wouldn’t want to be the person who had called shotgun previously. For such a scenario, you need to create a system that is hassle-free and makes the job easier by building a 
collaborative system where votes can be taken to play or skip a song.

## Achieved


Expectations from this system will be to get votes for songs to skip or keep playing, and in such a way that it uncovers all the perspective of managing the system itself. It will be sighted to show: 
- Control the music in some sense of unity?
- Security features? So, that only a person with the code can join the 
group?
- Different permissions will be given to all the members and whether the 
host can decide the roles of different members involved?
